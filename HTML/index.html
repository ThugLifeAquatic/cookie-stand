  <p> At Salmookies, we combine 2 of the most amazing foods on the planet, home-baked salmon and wild-caught, Alaskan cookies. Our salmon ingredients are sourced from ambiguous local Washington places, and our cookies are wild-caught, and shipped in fresh
    from Alaska. No farm raised cookies for us!</p>

  <p> You may be thinking "Hmm, salmon made with cookies doesn't sound that good", or "WTF is a wild-caught cookie?". If you're thinking the latter, you may be in the wrong dimension. If the first one is you, come on down to one of our many locations and
    give one a try. First cookie is on us!</p>
